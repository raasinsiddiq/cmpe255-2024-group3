Wave Energy Converters (WEC)

# PREREQUISITES
To run the application make sure you have the following libraries/modules installed:
1. customtkinter
2. tkinter
3. pandas
4. joblib
5. (optional) os if your python package did not come with it for some reason

# RUNNING THE APPLICATION
After you have installed the necessary modules, it is very simple to run the application. The steps are below:
1. Clone the repository
2. Run app.py in console or double click
3. Profit because you may have found your incredibly expensive WEC

Note: If you choose to browse for your own file make sure it is a CSV containing 1 row and 49 columns. Simple checking for this is done but this is not a mature product :) 
Sample files are provided to you in the repo under "wecs_test_data". These are also the same files used under the "Select Test CSV" option.
